One method is exported from this DLL. In order to accomplish this lab, you will need to do the following:

1.) Create a text file documenting what actions the exported function is capable of, and what input will cause it to do those things
2.) Create a program that will load and execute the exported function

At the end of the quiz, email the completed documents to the instructor staff.

**Remember: Good places to look (once you figure out the first function) might include strings and what methods the DLL imports
