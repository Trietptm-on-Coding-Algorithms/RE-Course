An Introduction to Reverse Engineering

----

C++ And You
===========

How C++ Works Under the Hood

----

Objectives
==========

* Understand and Identify Run Time Type Information (RTTI), and its uses
* Understand and Identify C++ Class Layouts in memory
* Understand how Inheritance Affects C++ in-memory structure
* Understand the composition of C++ class memory functions and vtables
* Understand and Identify the effect of C++ Templates on generated code

----

Exceptions
==========


----

Structured Exception Handling (SEH)
===================================

----

C++ Exceptions
==============

----

\*nix Exceptions
================

* Vary a bit by implementation
* Some older implementations relied on setjmp/longjmp
* Newer libs typically take a table-based approach (similar to Microsoft's)

----

Functions in C++
================

* Function implementation in C++ can vary rather widely
	+ Overloading 
	+ Templates
	+ Member Functions and Inheritence
* Also features differences in calling convention and implicit arguments
